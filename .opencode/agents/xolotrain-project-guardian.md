description: "Use this agent to evaluate scope and alignment with Xolotrain's design documents, timeline, and bounty requirements. Invoke before starting new features, when proposing architecture changes, during daily progress checks, or when timeline pressure forces scope decisions. This agent ensures implementation stays aligned with GAME_DESIGN.md, SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md, 6_DAY_TIMELINE.md, and bounty requirements while helping reconcile deviations with user input. Examples:\n\n<example>\nContext: About to implement a new feature\nuser: \"Let's add a pet marketplace where users can trade their axolotls\"\nassistant: <commentary>This is a new feature not in design docs. Should check with xolotrain-project-guardian for scope alignment and timeline impact before proceeding.</commentary>\nassistant: \"Before implementing this, let me check if it aligns with our design docs and timeline using the project guardian agent\"\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User wants to simplify architecture\nuser: \"Can we skip The Compact and just use direct Li.FI bridging?\"\nassistant: <commentary>This is a significant architecture change from LIFI_COMPACT_FEASIBILITY.md. Need to consult xolotrain-project-guardian to evaluate bounty impact and UX trade-offs.</commentary>\nassistant: \"This would change our core architecture. Let me consult the project guardian to evaluate the implications\"\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Starting Day 1 implementation\nuser: \"Let's start implementing the contracts\"\nassistant: <commentary>Good time for a scope check with xolotrain-project-guardian to confirm we're building the right contracts in the right order per timeline.</commentary>\nassistant: \"Let me verify our Day 1 scope with the project guardian before we begin\"\n</example>"
